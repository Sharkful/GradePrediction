# GradePrediction
This project aims to compare different architectures of neural network to find which perform the bests of academic performance prediction tasks.

## Requirements
The project needs the following packages in order to run:
- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow
- keras
- matplotlib
- urllib
- sklearn

## Instructions

1. First clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Sharkful/GradePrediction.git
```

2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook file

## To Change Parameters

In order to change the data, features, model architecture and parameter size, modify the values in the block labelled "Parameters for the Experiment" And rerun all following cells. The model will automatically adjust to the new parameters, and the results will be saved into a seperate file in the results folder.
